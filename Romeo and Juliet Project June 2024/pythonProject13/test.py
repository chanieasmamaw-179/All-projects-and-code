input_text = """Climate change and weather dynamic is the cross-cutting issue all over the world. For developing
countries, especially for East Saharan African countries including Ethiopia, the backbone of the economy depends on
 agriculture and accurate weather information is demanding. Most of the weather information is obtained from
 traditional surface meteorology stations. The weather information obtained from this station is not accurate enough,
  had recording bias, and lacked a digital data center. The main objective of this research is to estimate and retrieve
   atmospheric parameters such as precipitable water vapour (PWV) using ground-based GPS and remote sensing techniques
    such as GPS Radio Occultation (RO) for accurate weather studies and forecasting. The specific objective of this
    work was to estimate the regional vertical Total Electron Content (vTEC) densities, using a linear combination
     of L1 and L2 carrier phases for higher-order time delays at different thin-shell layers of the ionosphere over
     GPS stations in Ethiopia. Besides this, we estimate the GPS zenith delays to characterize the error of the
     neutral troposphere. During this research, we collected raw observational datasets using ground-based GPS
     from 2012 to 2015 and applied formulas to process GPS observed data through GPS Analysis (GAMIT/GLOBK)
     software."""
